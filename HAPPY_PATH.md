# HAPPY PATH: The Money Log Experience

## 1. First-Time Setup (The "Fresh Start")
*Goal: Establish trust and mirror reality.*

1.  **Account Creation:** The user signs up with email/password. No credit card, no "connect your bank" anxiety.
2.  **Reality Check (Accounts):**
    *   The user is asked: "Where is your money right now?"
    *   They add "Checking" ($2,500), "Savings" ($10,000), and "Wallet" ($45).
    *   *Result:* Total System Value is $12,545.
3.  **Strategy (Groups & Buckets):**
    *   The user sees a default "Needs" group. They add "Rent" and "Groceries".
    *   They create a "Savings Goals" group and add "Emergency Fund".
    *   *Mental Model:* At this exact moment, they have $12,545 in "To Be Budgeted".
4.  **Allocation (Giving Dollars a Job):**
    *   The user "moves" $10,000 from "To Be Budgeted" to "Emergency Fund".
    *   They move $1,500 to "Rent" for next month.
    *   They leave the rest in "To Be Budgeted" or "Groceries".
    *   *Result:* Every dollar has a place. The user feels organized.

## 2. Daily Usage (The "Coffee Shop" Moment)
*Goal: Frictionless capture.*

1.  **The Trigger:** The user buys a coffee for $4.50 using their Debit Card.
2.  **Immediate Action:** While waiting for the drink, they open the app.
3.  **The Input:**
    *   Tap "+" (Add Transaction).
    *   Type "4.50".
    *   Select "Expense".
    *   Account defaults to "Checking" (last used).
    *   Bucket? They tap "Dining Out" (or "Wants").
    *   Tap "Save".
4.  **Feedback:** The app immediately shows "Dining Out: $45.50 remaining". The user closes the app.
5.  *Time elapsed:* 8 seconds.

## 3. Weekly Review (The "Friday Check-in")
*Goal: Course correction without guilt.*

1.  **Scan:** The user opens the Dashboard. They see "Groceries" is 80% used, but it's only the 15th of the month.
2.  **Adjustment:** They realize they overspent on snacks.
3.  **The Trade-off:** They decide to cover the overage. They initiate a "Bucket Move".
    *   From: "Dining Out" (which has extra).
    *   To: "Groceries".
    *   Amount: $50.
4.  **Peace of Mind:** The total money hasn't changed, but the plan has updated to match reality. No red numbers, just reprioritization.

## 4. Monthly Review (The "Rollover")
*Goal: Reset and Refocus.*

1.  **Closing the Month:** The user sees that "Rent" was paid (balance $0).
2.  **Sinking Funds:** They see "Car Repair" has grown by $100 this month (automated mental accrual). They didn't spend it, so it sits there, growing.
3.  **Income Event:** Payday hits ($3,000).
    *   Log Income -> "Checking".
    *   Bucket -> "To Be Budgeted".
4.  **Funding the New Month:**
    *   They see $3,000 in "To Be Budgeted".
    *   They fill "Rent" ($1,500).
    *   They fill "Groceries" ($400).
    *   They add to "Vacation Fund" ($200).
    *   *Result:* Ready for the next 30 days.

## 5. Mental Model: Sinking Funds & Goals
*How it feels different from a spreadsheet.*

*   **The Problem:** In a spreadsheet, $10,000 in a savings account looks like a blob of money. Users often "borrow" from it mentally for a vacation, then forget it was meant for a House Downpayment.
*   **The Money Log Way:**
    *   The user sees "Savings Account: $10,000".
    *   BUT, below that, they see:
        *   bucket: "House Downpayment: $8,000"
        *   bucket: "New Laptop: $1,500"
        *   bucket: "Car Repair: $500"
    *   **The Conflict:** They want to go on a trip that costs $1,000.
    *   **The Realization:** They check "To Be Budgeted". It's $0. They look at the buckets. To take this trip, they MUST take money out of "House Downpayment" or "New Laptop".
    *   **The Decision:** The app forces them to admit "I am prioritizing this trip over my new laptop." It makes the trade-off explicit and painful, which curbs impulse spending.
